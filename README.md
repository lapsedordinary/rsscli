RSSCLI: command line RSS reader and social bookmarking tool

I wrote this project for personal use, partly to learn Python (a previous version of this tool existed in Perl). It combines a command line RSS reader with a social bookmarking tool. It's written for Linux (Linux Mint, in particular, but that shouldn't really matter). There will probably be some dependencies that are missing, but you can install them easily if you know a tiny, tiny bit about Python.
